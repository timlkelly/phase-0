- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was good to see how it all came together.  Learning about individual tags and elements is great and important, as they are the building blocks, but it makes more sense when you put the blocks together.  

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

There is a lot of information out there! It almost becomes overwhelming and difficult to quickly parse through it all and see which offer better answers.  I'm sure in time I'll locate specific sites that I like to use and return it.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We used a table to format the webpage.  Now, reflecting on it I don't think we used a very good method.  I guess we'll find out but I remember that tables can get very messy and cumbersome.  We thought about using <div> but our knowledge on div was minimal.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

The semantic approach to HTML is almost a benefit to HTML.  Separating the parts of the website make it easier to deal with.  That being said, without a full plan it can be difficult to visualize the website until style and formatting are added with CSS.  At least for myself at this point.  I hope more familiarity with it will make the process cleaner.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

A lot of HTML seems fairly intuitive.  The tags aren't that obscure and I have limited previous experience with HTML so I already have a memory for them.
