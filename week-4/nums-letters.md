#What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number or a number with no decimal point while a float is a number with a decimal point also known as a decimal number.

#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will result in a whole number, rounding down if necessary.  Float division will result in a float answer.  Loosely translated, Float division includes the remainder while integer division simply rounds down.
