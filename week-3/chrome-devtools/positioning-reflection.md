#3.3 Reflection

#How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements

It's extremely helpful to see the changes in CSS code actively, rather than making changes, saving them, and then reloading the page.  The devtools also assists in locating code and seeing how it effects the page.  

#How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?



#What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

#What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

The Margin surrounds the border of the element and has to do with its location in relation to other elements.  The border surrounds the object itself, outlining it though it can be adjusted by the padding, which is inbetween the object and the border.

#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

This challenge was very useful.  While it definitely got frustrating at times, it was a great way to begin learning about css positioning.
