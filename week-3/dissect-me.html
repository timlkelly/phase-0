			<article><h4>The Benefits of Version Control</h4>

			<p>Version Control is the name given to a group of tools that allow developers (and non-developers, poets, writers, etc.) to track the progress of their work and create backups.  The specific tool we have and will be using in DBC is called git.  Git is a local piece of software that sits on your computer and works in conjunction with your command line.  In order to use it, simply type "git ..." followed by a variety of commands.  Another tool that then works in conjunction with git (which is working in conjunction with your home terminal) is called GitHub.  GitHub is used as a remote component to the local git software and allows users to upload, store, and share their version control output.  GitHub also functions as a significant part of the open-source community.</p>

			<article><p>Version control is a way of keeping detailed copies of your work.  While it isn't a new concept to me, I have never used a system to this caliber.  In the most simple form version control lets you save copies of your work that you can revert back to if needed.  Though that isn't all it does.  Version control also simplifies collaboration and group work when working on and sharing the same project.

       		 There are a lot of different version control systems available but for this program we're using Git.  Git is a popular and free option for version control. Git allows you to add messages to each of your commits, or saves.  This is a great feature because it let's me leave notes about all of the changes I've made to a project. I can only imagine how helpful this will be throughout dev boot camp.

        I'll be using a website called GitHub where I can store and backup my work. GitHub is more than just a remote server for backups though.  It is a huge online community where you can share and collaborate with others on projects. I've used it in the past to find other people's work but it'll be great to now be able to submit my own as well.

<!-- 

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Header, main, article, footer.  The brevity and ease of these tags is extremely useful.  


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out on a page determined by formatting, usually a CSS file but it can also be in the html file.  The browser displays the content first, then the layout, positioning and styling.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned how to create snippets in sublime, which was really cool. Of course this will be helpful in the future.  I've been meaning to look into sublime shortcuts, just haven't had an opportunity yet.
