# 1.1 Think about Time
I learned about time boxing for managing your time and meditation/flow for productivity.  Time boxing is setting a specific amount of time for a given task.  You must stop even if you have not completed the task and review.  This will be helpful to use through out phase 0 to go through each weekâ€™s assignments.  Currently I usually allot time to finish a given task all at once, which I think sometimes works but may not always be the most effective.  Phase0 will be a great opportunity to try time boxing and other time management techniques.  I hope to dedicate specific amounts of time each day of the week to phase0 so that the process is constant.

# 1.2 The command line
A shell is a command line interface which lets you use/interact with the computer.  Bash is a specific type of shell.  Most of this material is pretty straight forward and I didn't have a lot of difficulty with it.  I did fine the pipe/redirection commands to be slightly confusing.  I think that it will just take time to get comfortable with all of these command.  Yes I was successful with all of the commands. While very basic I think the commands to find and move through directories is very important.  I almost want to liken it to walking, something so very simple but necessary to be able to do other activities.

print working directory. shows what directory you're currently in
list directory. lists the directories in current directory
move. moves or renames files
change directory. changes your current directory
../ (i had to look this one up) used with cd to move back up through directories. Is it used with anything else?
touch. creates a empty file
less. shows you a text file page by page, allowing you to read through it
rmdir. remove directory.  pretty self explanatory
rm remove. used to delete files
help. shows the help page
