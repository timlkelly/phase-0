Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on github click the + icon in the upper right corner of the screen and click new repository. Name your repository, add a description, select if it will be public or private, check the initialize with a README file and pick your license type. Click create. Great you now have a new repository. Now we need to create a clone of it on your computer.  Copy the url of the repository.  Open the terminal, move yourself and create a directory where you want this clone to live.  Now that we have the directory we can clone the repository.  Type "git clone " followed by the URL you copied earlier.  ta-da!

Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the source code for a given piece of software is free and open to anyone who wants to use or modify it.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think open source is great! It really promotes collaboration and allows for other people to modify existing code, creating new things.  Open source is great for what it is and does, though I don't think it's for everything. It isn't the perfect end all be all to licensing so it definitely doesn't feel like a utopia. And there are other options for those who are more protective over their work.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing is very important.  It gives the creator credit for their work and determines how others can use the work.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

No mind blowing moments here.  It was an easy challenge to follow.  I am still trying to grasp all of git.  I am able to work through it but not completely comfortable yet.  I'm also trying to break my habit of typing get instead of git

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I haven't gone through them yet but I plan to do the command line and git excerises on codeacademy.
